# E-Commerce Analysis
## Overview
The goal of this project was to analyze e-commerce sales data in order to identify trends, understand customer behavior, and provide actionable business insights. The project was designed to support decision-making in areas such as product performance, delivery efficiency, and payment preferences.
## Background
With the rapid growth of online shopping, e-commerce businesses generate massive volumes of data daily â€” from sales transactions to customer orders and payment methods. Analyzing this data is essential for understanding business performance, customer behavior, and operational efficiency. 

This project simulates a real-world scenario where an e-commerce company needs a clear, visual overview of its sales activity over the course of a year. The dataset includes product details, order quantities, sales revenue, delivery statuses, and payment. This project focuses on organizing messy data and turning it into meaningful insights. The final outcome is an interactive dashboard that provides decision-makers with key metrics and trends to support business planning and performance tracking.
## Tools I Used
Microsoft Excel: For Data visualization, formulas, pivot tables, and charts.

Power Query: Used for Data cleaning and transformation

Slicers: For filtering by product, category, and delivery status.
## Analysis
The sales performance dashboard offers a rich visual landscape for dissecting key aspects of the business's revenue generation and operational efficiency. Through a combination of trend analysis, comparative metrics, and interactive filtering, the dashboard allows for a distinct understanding of sales patterns, customer behavior, and logistical performance.
### Determining Peaks and Dips
The Monthly Sales Trend line chart serves as a crucial tool for identifying temporal patterns in revenue. Peaks in the line, which is the high point observed around July/August with a revenue exceeding $1,800,000, indicate periods of high sales performance, potentially correlating with marketing campaigns, seasonal demand, or specific product launches. 
Conversely, dips, which is the lower point in February around $1,400,000, signify periods of lower sales, which might warrant further investigation into contributing factors such as economic downturns, competitive pressures, or internal operational challenges.

Similarly, the Quantity Sold Per Month line chart provides insights into the volume of sales, showing peaks like the approximately 1800 units sold around June and dips such as the roughly 1400 units sold in February. Comparing these trends reveals that while revenue peaked in late summer, the highest volume of sales occurred slightly earlier, suggesting potential variations in the average selling price over time.
### Analytical Methods and Tools
The primary analytical method employed in this dashboard is visual data analysis. By transforming raw sales data into intuitive charts and graphs, the dashboard facilitates the identification of patterns, trends, and outliers that might be less apparent in tabular data. 

The use of comparative analysis is evident in the bar charts, which allow for a direct comparison of performance across different products, categories, payment methods, and delivery statuses. The core tool utilized is Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, with robust data visualization and interactive capabilities. 
### Ascertaining Best Sellers
Focusing on promoting and ensuring the availability of these best sellers is paramount for maximizing revenue. As highlighted in the Total Price of Each Product chart, "Wireless Earbuds" and "Tablet" stand out as top revenue generators. 

Similarly, within the product categories, "Smart Devices" and "Technology" contribute the most to overall revenue. This analysis crucially enhances the inventory management, marketing strategies, and product development efforts, suggesting a potential focus on these high-performing items and categories.
### Understanding Customer Payment Preferences
The Total Revenue from Each Payment Method clearly indicates that "Card" is the dominant payment method, accounting for approximately $3,868,243.76 of the total revenue, followed by "Bank Transfer" at $6,102,038.85. "USSD" and "Wallet" represent smaller proportions of the total revenue. This information is important for optimizing the payment options offered, potentially reducing transaction fees associated with less popular methods like "Crypto" (which shows a significantly smaller share), and ensuring a seamless checkout experience for the majority of customers who prefer card and bank transfers.

This sales performance dashboard is a powerful analytical tool that transcends simple data presentation. Through its carefully chosen visualizations and interactive capabilities, it provides a comprehensive and dynamic understanding of sales performance across various critical dimensions. By monitoring these visualizations, the stakeholders can gain insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of these core processes and identify potential bottlenecks or areas for optimization, like the Delivery Status chart which shows a significant portion of revenue in "Delivered" status (around 5,000,000) but also a notable amount in "Pending" (over 2,000,000), which warrants attention.
